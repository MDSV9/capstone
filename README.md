# Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning (ML)

This project was conducted during a 12-week BrainStation Data Science bootcamp. The main objective was to build an Intrusion Detection model using ML capable of adapting to new types of network attacks, not easily detectable by conventional IDS solutions on the market.

## Why an ML IDS?

With the increasing frequency of attacks on private networks, a simple ML model trained on synthetic data and deployed to analyze PCAP data for anomaly detection is highly relevant to today's commercial security needs. The advantage of this IDS lies in its ability to become robust through extensive training on various data sources.
